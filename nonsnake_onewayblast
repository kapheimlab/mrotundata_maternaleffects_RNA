#This is the script for running a one-way blast to find the shared genes between Yocum et al 2018 and this paper's genes. 
#Because both are M. rotundata we decided to only run a one-way blast. Therefore the below script is just to that point. 
#Users can do their own filtering to find the shared genes. 
#all things in quotes need user input

#make sure that all fastas are in the same folder and you are in that folder

module load blast
makeblastdb -in 'fastas.dataset1' -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids
makeblastdb -in 'fastas.dataset2' -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids

blastn -query 'fastas.dataset1' -db 'fastas.dataset2' -out 'outputfilename' -evalue 10e-5 -outfmt 7 -max_target_seqs 1 -num_threads 16

#then use either similar rules to the other snakemakes or other means to filter based on genes of interest in either study. 
#because we only needed to look into which genes were significantly differentially expressed in early/late diapausing prepupae
#but sampled in November, we just pulled from that supplement. Below list is that:

Below is copied and pasted from the supplement file:
Diferentially regulated genes common to all within month treatment comparisons.
November Down Regulated Genes
Gene_ID Description ELab versus LLab ELab versus EField EField versus LField LLab versus LField
XLOC_002189 transcription factor SOX‐11 ‐0.941127 ‐0.669238 ‐1.155 ‐0.883115
XLOC_003692 xaa‐Pro aminopeptidase 1‐like ‐1.7173 ‐2.21259 ‐1.51848 ‐2.01377
XLOC_005534 putative fatty acyl‐CoA reductase CG5065‐ ‐1.04456 ‐0.640885 ‐1.34868 ‐0.945006
XLOC_006049 tyrosine hydroxylase isoform X1 ‐1.43081 ‐2.0184 ‐1.37369 ‐1.96129
XLOC_008673 NA ‐1.53605 ‐2.44247 ‐2.88614 ‐3.79257
XLOC_011899 elongation of very long chain fatty acids ‐1.65802 ‐1.77167 ‐0.744568 ‐0.858215
November Up Regulated Genes
Gene_ID Description ELab versus LLab ELab versus EField EField versus LField LLab versus LField
XLOC_004761 hexamerin 70b precursor 2.34809 1.46161 2.5034 1.61692
XLOC_009125 lipase 1‐like isoform X1; lipase 1‐like 1.29764 1.14252 1.41126 1.25614
XLOC_011394 leucine‐rich repeat neuronal protein 1‐like 0.860734 1.212 0.722264 1.07353
Therefore,
I only needed to see whether the below XLOC ID's were in our dataset of DEGs. 
(all fold changes for early and late were at least 1 for either elab vs llab or efield vs lfield, except for XLOC_011394)
Down-Regulated
XLOC_002189
XLOC_003692
XLOC_005534
XLOC_006049
XLOC_008673
XLOC_011899
Up-Regulated
XLOC_004761
XLOC_009125
XLOC_011394

None turned out to be significantly differentially expressed in our dataset!
